üìå PROBLEM STATEMENT: Linear Regression to Predict Restaurant Profit

You're the CEO of a restaurant franchise looking to expand into new cities.
You already have profit data from 20 cities and their populations.

üéØ GOAL:
Build a simple machine learning model using **Linear Regression** to:
- Learn the relationship between a city's population and expected monthly profit.
- Predict profit for a new city given its population.

üë®‚Äçüíª WHAT YOU WILL BUILD:
- A machine learning model using **gradient descent** to minimize cost.
- A way to visualize both data and the fitted regression line.
- A predictor that can estimate profits for cities with different population sizes.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ---------- STEP 1: LOAD AND RETURN DATA ----------
# This function returns example city population and profit data

# ---------- STEP 2: VISUALIZE THE DATA ----------
def plot_data(x, y):
    # Plot red 'x' markers at each (population, profit) point
    plt.scatter(x, y, c='red', marker='x', label='Training data')

# ---------- STEP 6: MAKE A PREDICTION ----------
# Predict profit given population using learned w and b
